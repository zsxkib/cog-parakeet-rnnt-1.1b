## Benchmark Comparison üìä
The ü§ó [Open ASR Leaderboard on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/asr/leaderboard) that ranks speech recognition models. It uses two main metrics for evaluation: Average Word Error Rate (WER) and Real-Time Factor (RTF), where _lower is better_. These metrics help in understanding a model's accuracy and efficiency in processing speech.

| Model                  | Average WER | RTF (1e-3) | AMI | Earnings22 | Gigaspeech | LS Clean | LS Other | SPGISpeech | Tedlium | Voxpopuli | Common Voice 9 |

## Intended Use üéØ
This model is designed for precise ASR tasks in voice recognition and transcription, effective in varied audio backgrounds. It's compatible with the NeMo toolkit for a range of uses.

## Ethical Considerations ü§î
Users should be mindful of data privacy and the potential for biases in speech recognition, ensuring fair and responsible use of the technology.

## Caveats and Recommendations ‚ö†Ô∏è
Optimized for 16,000 Hz mono-channel audio, the model outputs in lower-case English. Its training on a 65K-hour diverse dataset indicates robust performance, but testing in specific use cases is recommended.
